#Task1

# There are the following sequences of numbers:

# Implement a program that displays the next member of this sequence (or similar) on the screen.
# The user enters the sequence from the keyboard as a string. For example, the user enters the string 0,5,10,15,20,25 and the program should respond with the number 30.
